Secure and Encrypted Messaging Method applying Linear Algebra Theories.

* How it works:

- This software will ask you to create and fill out 2 matrices.
- Then it will multiply them by each other.
- The matrix result will have one or more vectors (depends on your entries)
- Software will take the sum of the first vector
- Then does (first vector % 26) to generate a key (# of shifts)
- Then it will ask you to enter your message to be encrypted
- After all these steps, it'll print the encrypted message

It's a one-way encryption.

* To run it:

Yo can use the Command Line

python caesar_encrypt.py

Then the software will guide you step by step.
